                <p>I am currently working as a preschool teacher and am a self-learned arts/crafts designer designing paper crafts for my class students.</p>

                <p>After exploring several options, I got an opportunity through Georgia Tech Boot camp to learn UX/UI designer courses. Given an opportunity,<br> I would like to expand my career with these new skills to prove myself in any industry.</p>

                <h2> User Research</h2>
                <p> In all my projects I followed these five step problem solving process. Part of this process is Research which is important step before designing any apps or websites. I am excited to see how my design is going to be after getting some inputs from users. Especially personas are my favourite part. Finally so proud to see the output showing some solution to my users.

                   <p> Above is my Group project 2, I am really happy to see my progress. we all worked as a team and build this Non-Porfit website of Respect ability app. From our Heuristic evaluation, respectability website scored moderately on Appearance/Aestheitc, poorly on content/content organisation as well as navigation. So we focused on those elements and desgined this website.</p>
